# Project Setup Instructions

## SetUp

1. Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.

2. Locate the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the root directory of the project.

3. In the `CMakeLists.txt` file, find the placeholder `ROOT_DIR`.

4. Replace the value of `ROOT_DIR` with the absolute path where the project is located on your system.

    For example:
    ```cmake
    set(ROOT_DIR "/path/to/your/project")
    ```

5. Save the changes.

Once this step is completed, your project is set up and ready to be built.
